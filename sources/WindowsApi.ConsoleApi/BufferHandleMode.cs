        /// Normally when ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT is set and text reaches the end of the line, the cursor will immediately move to the next line and the contents of the buffer will scroll up by one line. In contrast with this flag set, the scroll operation and cursor move is delayed until the next character arrives. The written character will be printed in the final position on the line and the cursor will remain above this character as if ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT was off, but the next printable character will be printed as if ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT is on. No overwrite will occur. Specifically, the cursor quickly advances down to the following line, a scroll is performed if necessary, the character is printed, and the cursor advances one more position.
